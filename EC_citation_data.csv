Privacy in e-commerce: examining user scenarios and privacy preferences,1999,808,Mark S. Ackerman/Lorrie Faith Cranor/Joseph Reagle,"Privacy is a necessary concern in electronic commerce. It is difficult, if not impossible, to complete a transaction without revealing some personal data–a shipping address, billing information, or product preference. Users may be unwilling to provide this necessary information or even to browse online if they believe their privacy is invaded or threatened. Fortunately, there are technologies to help users protect their privacy. P3P (Platform for Privacy Preferences Project) from the World Wide Web Consortium is one such technology …",https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/336992.336995
Internet demand under different pricing schemes,1999,43,Jörn Altmann/Björn Rupp/Pravin Varaiya,"1 Objectives Apart from offering Virtual Private Networks to corporations, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) presently do not segment their market in regard to network services. All users experience the same service quality regardless of their usage profile. However, there are numerous alternatives that are both technologically and economically viable. Different pricing structures [3] can meet requirements of different user groups, resulting in a higher overall value of the network. In this paper, we present an analysis of aggregate data from the …",https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/336992.336997
Contracting with uncertain level of trust,1999,212,Sviatoslav B. Brainov/Tuomas Sandholm,"The paper investigates the impact of trust on the form and the terms of contracts. A formal model of a bilateral game between a buyer and a seller is presented. The paper focuses on the case where the level of trustworthiness of the buyer is uncertain. It is shown that if the seller's trust equals the buyer trustworthiness, then the social welfare, the amount of trade and the agents' utility functions are maximized. It is demonstrated that underestimating the buyer's trustworthiness tends to harm both agents. The role of advance payment contracts …",https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/336992.336998
Nark: receiver-based multicast non-repudiation and key management,1999,42,Bob Briscoe/Ian Fairman,"The goal of this work is to separately control individual secure sessions between unlimited pairs of multicast receivers and senders while preserving the scalability of receiver initiated Internet multicast for the data transfer itself. Unlike other secure multicast solutions, there are absolutely no side-effects on other receivers when a single receiver joins or leaves a session. Each individual receiver can also reliably prove whether any fragment of the data hasn't been delivered or wasn't delivered on time (eg late video frames). Further, each …",https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/336992.336999
Automated strategy searches in an electronic goods market: learning and complex price schedules,1999,67,Christopher H. Brooks/Scott A. Fay/Rajarshi Das/Jeffrey K. MacKie-Mason/Jeffrey O. Kephart/Edmund H. Durfee,"Markets for electronic goods provide the possibility of exploring new and more complex pricing schemes, due to the flexibility of information goods and negligible marginal cost. In this paper we compare dynamic performance across price schedules of varying complexity. We provide a monopolist producer with two machine learning methods which implement a strategy that balances exploitation to maximize current profits against exploration to improve future profits. We find that the complexity of the price schedule affects both the amount of …",https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/336992.337000
Opportunistic exploration of large consumer product spaces,1999,25,Doug Bryan/Anatole Gershman,"The advent of the Web has brought an unprecedented amount of information together with a large, diverse set of users. Online users are performing a wider variety of tasks than ever before. For example, not only is the Web being used to search conventional databases like Lexis/Nexus, it is also being used to broker Beanie Babies®. Today's common information seeking metaphors (ie, keyword search and hypertext) cannot be expected to support all these new tasks well. We characterize a new user behavior called opportunistic exploration …",https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/336992.337003

A declarative approach to business rules in contracts: courteous logic programs in XML,1999,290,Benjamin N. Grosof/Yannis Labrou/Hoi Y. Chan,"We address why, and especially how, to represent business rules in e-commerce contracts. By contracts, we mean descriptions of goods and services offered or sought, including ancillary agreements detailing terms of a deal. We observe that rules are useful in contracts to represent conditional relationships, eg, in terms & conditions, service provisions, and surrounding business processes, and we illustrate this point with several examples. We analyze requirements (desiderata) for representing such rules in contracts. The …",https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/336992.337010
Enhancing privacy and trust in electronic communities,1999,237,Bernardo A. Huberman/Matthew K. Franklin/Tad Hogg,"A major impediment to using recommendation systems and collective knowledge for electronic commerce is the reluctance of individuals to reveal preferences in order to find groups of people that share them. An equally important barrier to fluid electronic commerce is the lack of agreed upon trusted third parties. We propose new non-third party mechanisms to overcome these barriers. Our solutions facilitate finding shared preferences, discovering communities with shared values, removing disincentives posed by liabilities, and negotiating …",https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/336992.337012
Middleware for software leasing over the Internet,1999,11,Hans-Arno Jacobsen/Oliver Günther,"Abstract MMM (Middleware for Method Management) is an infrastructure for managing the deployment, integration, distribution, and use of application services via the World Wide Web.

Truth revelation in approximately efficient combinatorial auctions,1999,1026,Daniel Lehmann/Liadan O'Callaghan/Yoav Shoham,"Some important classical mechanisms considered in Microeconomics and Game Theory require the solution of a difficult optimization problem. This is true of mechanisms for combinatorial auctions, which have in recent years assumed practical importance, and in particular of the gold standard for combinatorial auctions, the Generalized Vickrey Auction (GVA). Traditional analysis of these mechanisms---in particular, their truth revelation properties---assumes that the optimization problems are solved precisely. In reality, these …",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/585265.585266
VRCommerce - electronic commerce in virtual reality,1999,26,Yosi Mass/Amir Herzberg,"Existing technology and standards allow the creation of threedimensional, virtual-reality browsing experience. Such an interface may be more attractive and natural (at least to some). In particular, with the increase in electronic commerce, the creation of virtual reality stores and shopping malls seems of potential value. However, there are substantial challenges in the use of existing virtual reality tools to create any large space, in particular a store or a shopping mall. The main challenges are the substantial size of the representation …",https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/336992.337018
Distributed digital-ticket management for rights trading system,1999,65,Kazuo Matsuyama/Ko Fujimura,"This paper describes a digital-ticket management scheme for a generalized digital-ticket circulation system. Today, there are several digital-ticket or ticket-less systems that enable users to redeem tickets or purchase goods without getting a paper ticket. There are two main approaches: account-based and smart-cardbased digital-ticket systems. Most account-based systems require the service provider to maintain accounts for their users which increases ticketing costs.

A methodology for workload characterization of E-commerce sites,1999,410,Daniel A. Menascé/Virgílio A. F. Almeida/Rodrigo C. Fonseca/Marco A. Mendes,"Performance analysis and capacity planning for e-commerce sites poses an interesting problem: how to best characterize the workload of these sites. Tradition al workload characterization methods, based on hits/set, page views/set, or visits/set, are not appropriate for e-commerce sites. In these environments, customers interact with the site through a series of consecutive and related requests, called sessions. Different navigational patterns can be observed for different groups of customers. In this paper, we propose a methodology …",https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/336992.337024
Privacy preserving auctions and mechanism design,1999,952,Moni Naor/Benny Pinkas/Reuban Sumner,"We suggest an architecture for executing protocols for auctions and, more generally, mechanism design. Our goal is to preserve the privacy of the inputs of the participants (so that no nonessential information about them is divulged, even a posteriori) while maintaining communication and computational efficiency. We achieve this goal by adding another party-the auction issuer-that generates the programs for computing the auctions but does not take an active part in the protocol. The auction issuer is not a trusted party, but is assumed not to …",https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/336992.337028
Paris metro pricing for the internet,1999,512,Andrew M. Odlyzko,"TCP and UDP, with each packet treated equally. The only difference between the channels would be that they would charge different prices. Customers would choose the channel to send their packets on (on a packet-by-packet basis, if they wished), and would pay accordingly. There would be no formal guarantees of quality of service, with packets handled on a “best effort” basis. The expectation is that the channels with higher prices would be less congested than those with lower prices, and thus provide better service. All …",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/336992.337030

Brokering strategies in electronic commerce markets,1999,44,Arie Segev/Carrie Beam,"Online brokers are inventing strategies as fast as they move online. Some strategies are being implemented already, such as the Yahoo! model of advertiser-supported brokerage, or the eBay model supported by commissions charged to sellers, but there is no theoretical backing for either of these two models compared to the wide variety of auction theory. The services offered by brokers are also evolving very rapidly. In this paper we first provide an overview of the evolving brokering practices and limitations of existing work. We then …",https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/336992.337038
E-commerce over communicators: challenges and solutions for user interfaces,1999,11,Mona Singh/Anuj K. Jain/Munindar P. Singh,"Norman argues forcefully that information appliances (or “invisible computers”) of the sort of communicators can fundamentally be more usable and thus more popular than traditional computers [5]. We agree with this assessment and think of communicators and their relatives as becoming ever more popular.(We revisit other aspects of Norman's position in section 4.4.) As communicators (and related devices such as palmtops and PDAs) become more prevalent, it is natural that they will be used to conduct electronic commerce.

Bidding and allocation in combinatorial auctions,2000,716,Noam Nisan,"When an auction of multiple items is performed, it is often desirable to allow bids on combinations of items, as opposed to only on single items. Such an auction is often called"" combinatorial"", and the exponential number of possible combinations results in computational intractability of many aspects regarding such an auction. This paper considers two of these aspects: the bidding language and the allocation algorithm. First we consider which kinds of bids on combinations are allowed and how, ie in what language …",https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/352871.352872
Optimal solutions for multi-unit combinatorial auctions: branch and bound heuristics,2000,205,Rica Gonen/Daniel Lehmann,Finding optimal solutions for multi-unit combinatorial auctions is a hard problem and finding approximations to the optimal solution is also hard. We investigate the use of Branch-and-Bound techniques: they require both a way to bound from above the value of the best allocation and a good criterion to decide which bids are to be tried first. Different methods for efficiently bounding from above the value of the best allocation are considered. Theoretical original results characterize the best approximation ratio and the ordering criterion that …,https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/352871.352873

What is actually taking place on web sites: e-commerce lessons from web server logs,2000,45,Mark Rosenstein,"ABSTRACT A prime business concern is knowing your customer. One legacy carried into the present from the earliest NCSA web servers is web server logs. While there are more powerful user tracking techniques, such as requiring logins or storing cookies, server logs remain a powerful tool in helping understand customer activity on a web site, and are the only tool when logins are not desirable or cookies are blocked by browsers or firewalls. This paper details the possibilities and pitfalls in using web server logs to understand customer …",https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/352871.352876
Pricing strategies on the Web: evidence from the online book industry,2000,34,Karen Clay/Ramayya Krishnan/Eric Wolff,"Using data collected between August 1999 and January 2000, we examine firm-level pricing strategies for 32 online bookstores. The data cover more than 300 books, including New York Times bestsellers, computer bestsellers, and random books. Over the period, standard deviation of price fell slightly, and prices for the different types of books were substantially above cost and flat or increasing. Thus predicted price convergence has not yet occurred. An average firm priced random paperback nonfiction books at 94 percent of the cover price …",https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/352871.352877

Towards a universal test suite for combinatorial auction algorithms,2000,500,Kevin Leyton-Brown/Mark Pearson/Yoav Shoham,"General combinatorial auctions—auctions in which bidders place unrestricted bids for bundles of goods—are the subject of increasing study. Much of this work has focused on algorithms for finding an optimal or approximately optimal set of winning bids. Comparatively little attention has been paid to methodical evaluation and comparison of these algorithms. In particular, there has not been a systematic discussion of appropriate data sets that can serve as universally accepted and well motivated benchmarks. In this paper we present a …",https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/352871.352879
Interactions of automated pricing algorithms: an experimental investigation,2000,14,Cary A. Deck/Bart J.

This paper employs the method of experimental economics to examine human behavior in environments where multiple automated pricing algorithms are available for use. The results of the experiments reported here indicate that individuals prefer using automated pricing algorithms to setting prices manually. However, neither a pricebeating nor a price-matching automated rule is dominant in terms of the frequency of usage. We find that the composite …",https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/352871.352880

Price wars and niche discovery in an information economy,2000,24,Christopher H. Brooks/Edmund H. Durfee/Rajarshi Das,"Electronic goods are flexible and have negligible marginal costs. These features allow a producer of electronic goods to explore pricing schemes, and in particular bundling, that would not be feasible with physical goods. However, they can also make it more difficult for a producer to differentiate itself from competitors offering identical goods. Previous research in this area indicates that in markets where producers compete over the sale of identical information goods, cyclical price wars often develop.

Empirically, however, this prediction does not necessarily hold. Although average prices and profits are lower online than o"" ine, there are significant exceptions; and price dispersion has actually risen. Why does this happen? Using a formal analytic model, we argue that firms can resist comparison shopping by customizing their goods and, in particular, the shopping experience.

While we show that the allocation problem among valuations with decreasing marginal utilities is NP-hard, we present an …",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/501158.501161
Accelerating information revelation in ascending-bid auctions: avoiding last minute bidding,2001,18,Shigeo Matsubara,"An ascending-bid auction protocol with a fixed end time has been widely used at many Internet auction sites. At these sites, we can observe bidders engaging in the behavior called last minute bidding, namely, a large fraction of the bids for a good are submitted in the closing seconds of the auction. This can cause problems such as information revelation failure as well as server overload and network congestion. When bidders behave in this way, each of them cannot obtain information about the good from the other bidders' bidding …",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/501158.501162

Optimal design of English auctions with discrete bid levels,2005,96,Esther David/Alex Rogers/Jeremy Schiff/Sarit Kraus/Nicholas R.

Such discrete bid auctions require that the bidders submit bids at predetermined discrete bid levels, and thus, there exists a minimal increment by which the bid price may be raised. In contrast, the academic literature of optimal auction design deals almost solely with continuous bid auctions. As a result, there is little practical guidance as to how an auctioneer, seeking to maximize its revenue, should determine the number and …",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1239971.1239976

We first observe that pure Nash-equilibria of this game excatly correspond to price-based equilibiria (and thus need not exist), but that mixed-Nash equilibria always do exist, and we analyze their structure in several simple cases where no …",https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.3950

Devanur/Lei Wang,"In Internet ad auctions, search engines often throttle budget constrained advertisers so as to spread their spends across the specified time period. Such policies are known as budget smoothing policies. In this paper, we perform a principled, game-theoretic study of what the outcome of an ideal budget smoothing algorithm should be. In particular, we propose the notion of regret-free budget smoothing policies whose outcomes throttle each advertiser optimally, given the participation of the other advertisers.

Why marketplace experimentation is harder than it seems: the role of test-control interference,2014,63,Thomas Blake/Dominic Coey,Classical statistical inference of experimental data assumes that the treatment affects the test group but not the control group. This assumption will typically be violated when experimenting in marketplaces because of general equilibrium effects: changing test demand affects the supply available to the control group. We illustrate this with an email marketing campaign performed by eBay. Ignoring test-control interference leads to estimates of the campaign's effectiveness which are too large by a factor of around two.

Finding Any Nontrivial Coarse Correlated Equilibrium Is Hard,2015,23,Siddharth Barman/Katrina Ligett,"One of the most appealing aspects of correlated equilibria and coarse correlated equilibria is that natural dynamics quickly arrive at approximations of such equilibria, even in games with many players. In addition, there exist polynomial-time algorithms that compute exact correlated and coarse correlated equilibria. However, in general these dynamics and algorithms do not provide a guarantee on the quality (say, in terms of social welfare) of the resulting equilibrium. In light of these results, a natural question is how good are the …",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2845926.2845929

Queue Lengths as Constantly Adapting Prices: Allocative Efficiency Under Random Dynamics,2020,3,Itai Ashlagi/Jacob D.

Examples include the allocation of cadaver organs to patients in need of a transplant, public housing apartments to applicants, health care services to patients, and even spots at childcare centers to parents. In all these markets waiting times play the role of prices in guiding the allocation and rationing items.

The Complexity of Pacing for Second-Price Auctions,2021,20,Xi Chen/Christian Kroer/Rachitesh Kumar,"Budget constraints are ubiquitous in online advertisement auctions. To manage these constraints and smooth out the expenditure across auctions, the bidders (or the platform on behalf of them) often employ pacing: each bidder is assigned a multiplier between 0 and 1, and her bid on each item is multiplicatively scaled down by the multiplier. This naturally gives rise to a game in which each bidder strategically selects a multiplier. The appropriate notion of equilibrium in this game is the pacing equilibrium.

Sampling from the Gibbs Distribution in Congestion Games,2021,1,Pieter Kleer,"Logit dynamics is a form of randomized game dynamics where players have a bias towards strategic deviations that give a higher improvement in cost [3, 6]. It is used extensively in practice, but not well-understood from a theoretical perspective. In congestion (or potential) games [8], the dynamics converges to the so-called Gibbs distribution over the set of all strategy profiles, when interpreted as a Markov chain (see, eg,[2]).

Optimal Stopping with Behaviorally Biased Agents: The Role of Loss Aversion and Changing Reference Points,2021,2,Jon M. Kleinberg/Robert Kleinberg/Sigal Oren,"One of the central human biases studied in behavioral economics is reference dependence-people's tendency to evaluate an outcome not in absolute terms but instead relative to a reference point that reflects some notion of the status quo [4]. Reference dependence interacts closely with a related behavioral bias, loss aversion, in which people weigh losses more strongly than gains of comparable absolute values. Taken together, these two effects produce a fundamental behavioral regularity in human choices: once a reference point has …",https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3465456.3467568

Robust Data-Driven Decisions Under Model Uncertainty,2022,1,Xiaoyu Cheng,"In data-driven decisions, while the extrapolation from sample data is often based on observable similarities within a population, one also needs to take into account possible unobserved heterogeneity across individuals in the population.

On the Optimality of Greedy Policies in Dynamic Matching,2022,14,Süleyman Kerimov/Itai Ashlagi/Itai Gurvich,We study centralized dynamic matching markets with finitely many agent types and heterogeneous match values. A network topology describes the pairs of agent types that can form a match and the value generated from each match. A matching policy is hindsight optimal if the policy can (nearly) maximize the total value simultaneously at all times. We find that suitably designed greedy policies are hindsight optimal in two-way matching networks. This implies that there is essentially no positive externality from having agents waiting to …,https://web.stanford.edu/~kerimov/GreedyKAG.pdf

Shorrer/Sándor Sovago,"In recent years, a growing number of students are being assigned to schools through centralized clearinghouses. The success of such clearinghouses crucially relies on the use of a stable matching mechanism [10, 12]. The matching market design literature finds that a designer who wishes to implement a stable allocation has limited scope for further design. First, the rural hospital theorem determines that the same positions are filled in all stable allocations [7, 9].

Equity in Resident Crowdsourcing: Measuring Under-reporting without Ground Truth Data,2022,2,Zhi Liu/Nikhil Garg,"Modern city governance relies heavily on crowdsourcing (or"" co-production"") to identify problems such as downed trees and power-lines. A major concern in these systems is that residents do not report problems at the same rates, leading to an inequitable allocation of government resources.

Efficient Capacity Provisioning for Firms with Multiple Locations: The Case of the Public Cloud,2022,0,Patrick Hummel/Michael Schwarz,"We analyze a model in which a firm with multiple locations chooses capacity and prices to maximize efficiency. We find that the firm provisions capacity in such a way that the expected fraction of demand that will be unfilled is lower in locations with greater expected demand. The firm also sets lower prices in larger locations. Finally, if a customer is indifferent between multiple locations, then it is more efficient to place this customer in a location with greater expected demand.
